# Codealpha-EDA.project
This project is part of my data analyst internship, where I performed *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* and created *data visualizations* using the Titanic dataset.

The goal is to discover meaningful insights from the dataset and present them visually using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Understand the structure and contents of the Titanic dataset
- Clean and explore the data using basic EDA techniques
- Visualize survival trends based on gender, age, and class
- Communicate key insights using graphs and charts

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 💡 Key Insights

- *Female passengers had a much higher survival rate* than males.
- Passengers in *1st class* were more likely to survive than those in 2nd or 3rd.
- Most passengers were young adults or middle-aged.
- *Missing values* were present in 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' columns.
